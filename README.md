## Erika Snow | Wrestling Tournament Stats
This project is designed to allow the user to quickly input the results from a match in a wrestling tournament and keep track of the winners. The project also allows for these results to be updated and deleted as necessary. This could be useful, as wrestling tournaments are very fast-paced, with little time between matches, and generally multiple matches at once. With a single database to keep track of all of these matches, this web application could assist the tournament facilitators by automatically updating them on the status of each match. This would be much faster than the current system, where the facilitators are required to check in with the score keepers after each match ends. Ultimately, this could prevent the tounament from getting behind schedule.
